nothing seems to work. so starting over with war.
enabled tcp in system
just a few plugins
the incantation on the agent page to connect the agent to the controller works.
no luck with any connection from larie's machine. (check this again)
need to add docker plugins
filesharing message from windoze
then the absolute path problem:
    agent-86 does not seem to be running inside a container
    the working directory 'c:/agent-86/workspace/d1/' is invalid, it needs to be an absolute path.
    docker job was run by 86.

the certs problem
    turned off everything i could find - mo joy.
    found the none option under seecurity realm.
    selected done. hit save. oops - no jenkins

so lets just try some jenkins files and maybe some casc stuff.
nothing obvious to try except maybe the first example? 

lets try a custom workspace. maybe it will get by the absolute path problem.

turned off running jobs on the controller as recommended.
made an agent and: javaws http://192.168.1.6:8081/computer/agent-86/jenkins-agent.jnlp
this works fine on my machine.
