msi 8089 jenkins home /c/Windows/System32/config/systemprofile/AppData/Local/Jenkins/

this is now chief https://github.com/rtayek/chief.git

set up agents and have them run jobs
make the tf1 image and load it to dockerhub

try to clone from local file system - seems to work well.


first job runs job1.bat advanced custom workspace need for batch file.
running dependent job will do a pull so it will get the latest

fix the crlf's - use: git config --list --show-origin

 agent { // set up am agent to run the python job
    docker {
      image 'node:6-alpine'
      args '-p 3000:3000'
    }
use job dsl to install jobs 
use gradle wrapper on chief so he can download the jenkins war if not present !!!
or maybe just groovy and grape.
add tomcat?
python venvs
common groovy script - maybe just put in master custom workspace with a git pull
