this is now chief https://github.com/rtayek/chief.git
so i guess we clone and import into eclipse.
set up agents and have them run jobs
make the tf1 image and load it to dockerhub

try to clone from local file system


job-1 was:
git clone https://github.com/rtayek/chief.git
rem dir chief
chief\job-1.bat
docker --version
gradle --version
mad it shorted to try to get sh to work.

first job runs job1.bat advanced custom workspace need for batch file.
running dependent job will do a pull so it will get the latest

Node - A machine which is part of the Jenkins environment and capable of executing Pipelines or Projects.
Both the Controller [master] and Agents [slave] are considered to be Nodes.

unresolved https://issues.jenkins.io/browse/JENKINS-60473

maybe since we have the jenkins war as a dependency
we could just call it from a java program. yes, but not working yet.

fix the crlf's - use: git config --list --show-origin

 agent { // set up am agent to run the python job
    docker {
      image 'node:6-alpine'
      args '-p 3000:3000'
    }
use job dsl to install jobs 
use gradle wrapper on chief so he can download the jenkins war if not present
or maybe just groovy and grape.
add tomcat?
python venvs
common groovy script - maybe just put in master custom workspace with a git pull 

ran into this problem again:
